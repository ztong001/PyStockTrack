#An Introduction to Stock Market Data Analysis with Python

###Authored by Curtis Miller from this [blogpost](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/introduction-stock-market-data-python-1/)

This is an experiment using Python to get stock market data from Yahoo Finance/Google Finance and project it on a plot graph for data analysis.
This is **NOT** a stock market prediction algorithm, it only tracks the price changes in the stock market.

Description:
- Depends on pandas, pandas_datareader(**NEW**), matplotlib and numpy.
- You can track different stocks by referencing their ticker symbol within the code.
- IPython is needed for matplotlib to display the graph.
