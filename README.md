#An Introduction to Stock Market Data Analysis with Python

###Adapted from Curtis Miller from his [blog](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com)

This is an experiment using Python to get stock market data from Yahoo Finance/Google Finance and project it on a plot graph for data analysis.
This is **NOT** a stock market prediction algorithm, it only tracks the price changes in the stock market.

Requirements:
- Python 3.x and above.
- Depends on pandas, pandas_datareader(**NEW**), matplotlib and numpy.
- IPython is needed for matplotlib to display the graph.

You can refer to the specific blog posts in the folders [Part 1](/Part 1) and [Part 2](/Part 2). Part 1 focuses on the basic tools for handling and analyzing stock market data. Part 2 covers trading strategies using moving averages over a period of time and formulating exit strategies upon entering a position. The evaluation of a strategy is also elaborated by the use of backtesting. 

To see the graphs, uncomment the line "plt.show()".

To install the dependencies:

```Shell
pip install requirements.txt
```
