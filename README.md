#An Introduction to Stock Market Data Analysis with Python by Curtis Miller

##Original source from this [blogpost](https://ntguardian.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/introduction-stock-market-data-python-1/)

This is an experiment using Python to get stock market data from Yahoo Finance/Google Finance and project it on a plot graph for data analysis.
This is **NOT** a stock market prediction algorithm, it only tracks the price changes in the stock market.

Description:
    - Dependencies on pandas, matplotlib and numpy.
    - Current example uses Google, you can track different stocks by referencing their ticker symbol within the code.
    - IPython might be needed to display the graph.
